      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p id="about-me">
        <p>
          My interests growing up was playing video games, watching anime, reading manga and webtoons etc -- which eventually grew into attempting to draw and sketch such media.
          I enjoyed discovering new art mediums but I always stuck to the same cheap and affordable things: pens. 
        </p>
        <p> I drew almost everyday, tracing, copying, creating original character designs inspired from various pop culture.
        </p>
        <p> 
          My biggest inspiration when I was growing up were the works of Akira Amano (Katekyo Hitman Reborn! and Psycho-Pass character design).

          <h2>Travels</h2>
          <p>
            I planned my first ever 3 week trip to Japan. I headed to Tokyo first for the first 6 days which was where I jumpstarted my stationery shopping. 
            The first pen I got was the Pilot Kakuno in the family series. I had to buy a converter and a Pilot Blue Black ink to go with it as well. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the stationery stores that I visited:
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/t.s.l_store/?hl=en">Kurashiki TSL</a> for custom Traveler's Co; located in Kurashiki </li>

        <h2>Journaling</h2>
          <p> 
          One of the things I do to make use of all the pens I have is to journal for wellness and day to day reflection. I use stickers for mood tracking or general goal setting,
          and I write with fountain pens of various ink colours, ballpoints for fast drying or gel pens for colourful inks in a fast drying formula.
          </p>
         <p> 
          This year (2025), I have been using my Hobonichi English edition in A6. I have the pencil board, a custom cover and cover on cover to protect the fabric. 
          The only issue I have is that I bought a smaller size since I really don't have that much to do during the day... but I like to sketch so that is also
          a great way of filling up the page. I already splurged on two planners next year in a weekly slim size notebook and a traditional A5 size as well.
